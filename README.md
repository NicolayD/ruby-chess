Solution for the final project ([Chess](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project?ref=lc-pb)) from the [Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming) chapter of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home).
The game is based on the command line.

The game will use the unicode chess pieces.

Game logic works fine. Check and checkmate work, the checked player must choose a move out of the checked position.
Draw checks also work (only automatic draws). Save game option is also available. Only castling and en passant are not available yet. Some of the verbose code needs refactoring. Some specs have yet to be added.
