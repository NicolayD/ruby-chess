Solution for the final project ([Chess](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project?ref=lc-pb)) from the [Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming) chapter of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home).
This is a chess game based on the command line, which uses the unicode chess pieces.

Save game option available after each turn.  

Only automatic draw checks implemented. Castling and en passant are not available yet.  

Some specs have yet to be added. I will also add more methods and possibly modules to make the code more readable and less verbose.
