Solution for the final project ([Chess](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project?ref=lc-pb)) from the [Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming) chapter of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home).
The game is based on the command line.

The game will use the unicode codes for the chess pieces.

Currently, the rspec version is 2.14 as it is the last stable version for Windows, but I will update it once I refactor the code on a different OS.

It will be developed slowly and pushed gradually to github.
