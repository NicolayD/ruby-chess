Solution for the final project ([Chess](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project?ref=lc-pb)) from the [Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming) chapter of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home).
This is a chess game based on the command line, which uses the unicode chess pieces.

Draw checks are only automatic draws. Save game option is also available. Only castling and en passant are not available yet.  

Some specs have yet to be added.
