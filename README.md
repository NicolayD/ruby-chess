Solution for the final project ([Chess](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project?ref=lc-pb)) from the [Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming) chapter of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home).
The game is based on the command line and uses the unicode chess pieces.

Draw checks are only automatic draws. Save game option is also available. Only castling and en passant are not available yet. Some specs have yet to be added.
